# The MechatronicUML Tool Suite

The MechatronicUML Tool Suite (MUML TS) is an Eclipse-based IDE for using the [MechatronicUML](http://www.mechatronicuml.org/de/index.html). As no working download is currently available on the web, we provide a download here via this GitHub repository.

## Installation instructions

1) Download the zip-File linked under "Releases", unzip it.
2) Install a Java 8 VM if you don't have one on your local machine.
3) If you work with multiple JVMs on your machine (or if you just want to be explicit): configure the Java 8 VM as runtime environment for the MUML TS by editing the eclipse.ini file in the unzipped directory. Add 
```
-vm
<path-to-your-java8vm>
```
4) Start the MUML TS by executing the eclipse.exe in the unzipped directory.
